# Alpahgo applied to OMOK #
* The goal of the project is to apply alphago system to a simpler board game called OMOK.
* Currently, most codes written are from Google resesarch's alpha zero implementation.
* However, their codes are written using Tensorflow 1. 
* I converted it to Tensorflow 2.
* The training part has part has not been finished yet and OMOK implementation has not been finished yet.
* However, you can try selfplay part at this point:
